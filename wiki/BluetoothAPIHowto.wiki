#summary This page will contain code snippets to show how to use the Bluetooth API for Android.

= Initialization =

Don't forget to add following permissions to the AndroidManifest of your application:

{{{
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
}}}


The entry-point for the Bluetooth API is LocalBluetoothDevice class, that has to be initialized with a Context instance (for instance, current Activity):

{{{
LocalBluetoothDevice localBT = LocalBluetoothDevice.initLocalDevice(_context);
}}}


LocalBluetoothDevice *must* be closed before leaving the activity. The best is to close it in the onDestroy() callback:

{{{
@Override
protected void onDestroy() {
   if (localBT != null) {
   localBT.close();
   }
   super.onDestroy();
}
}}}
